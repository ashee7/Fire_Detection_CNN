# Fire_Detection_CNN
Objective: To create a classification model that can detect fire in images
Models used: Sequential CNN from scratch, Pretrained Xception with modifications

Data was collected to train a model to distinguish between the images that contain fire (fire images) and regular images (non-fire images). Data is divided into 2 folders, fireimages folder contains 755 outdoor-fire images some of them contains heavy smoke, the other one is non-fireimages which contain 244 nature images (eg: forest, tree, grass, river, people, foggy forest, lake, animal, road, and waterfall).
